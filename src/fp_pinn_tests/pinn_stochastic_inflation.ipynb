    "We are interested in obtaining the statistics of the stochastic $e$-fold to end of inflation $\\mathcal{N}$. The traditional method would be to simply simulate the inflaton-Langevin equation for $10^8 - 10^9$ realizations and generate an empirical distribution. However, such a method is very computationally expensive. More so, it still might not be adequate at resolving the rare event tail of the distribution, which is extremely important for the study of primordial black holes (PBHs).\n",
